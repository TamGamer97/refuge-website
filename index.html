        <img src="/assets/image-1.png" alt="Refuge Play Poster">

        <p><strong>Director:</strong> Pavan J Singh</p>
        <p><strong>Venue:</strong> Etcetera Theatre, 265 Camden High Street</p>
        <p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> Refuge is a one-man play that tells the story of Braham, an ordinary shopkeeper who is forced to leave the comforts of his home and take a perilous journey as he becomes a refugee. Braham shares how his hometown is slowly attacked and destroyed, and as the carnage gets closer to his own house, he makes the difficult decision to take his family and run for safety, by whatever means necessary. Along the way, he is helped by some, taken advantage of by others, and his family’s lives threatened on numerous occasions. All throughout, he reminisces about the priceless memories he leaves behind, conveying to the audience how his life was as beautiful, as real and as human as their own.</p>
        <p><strong>About the Artist:</strong> Pavan J Singh is an actor and theatre artist with almost 25 years of experience. He has worked with prominent theatre companies in Singapore and Malaysia. He is also a part-time lecturer and director of student productions working mostly with LASALLE College of the Arts.
